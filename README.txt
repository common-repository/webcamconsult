The way to improve your service efficiently. Research shows that webcam consultations are 40% more efficient than consultations by telephone! And everybody knows that a face to face conversation goes a lot quicker than typing text in a chatbox.


Visitors of your website are able to start a real-time video call with you from any websitepage you want. They only have to click one button to initiate the video call with you, pay online (Paypal, credit cards) if you want to charge for your service, and you will see them in your digital waiting room. You then initiate the video call with lots of facilities e.g. screensharing, file sharing, appointments, group meetings, quick consults, add persons etc. Webcamconsult is a premium plugin.

The application is customizable: change color schemes, add a company logo and names of agents. You can configure for online payments (Paypal, credit cards) for your consultation at your configured rate. In case your visitor has to wait, you are able to communicate your own content. You choose your opening hours, and your service is operational. For example: patients consult doctors, citizens their municipalities and customers are able to connect directly with agents of (online) shops.


New! Pop up version widget. Replaces “can I help you” chatbox. A face to face consultation is far more effective for your customers!

**Patient / client can book appointments themselves**
New booking widget: this makes it possible to show clients a booking agenda for each practitioner on your website or portal. In the same way as for example with booking .com for hotel reservations, patients / clients can book a consultation with the desired practitioner on the desired date and time. In the dashboard, the availability of each practitioner can be stored in a calendar (timeslots) and you can set how many consultations are possible per hour. 

**Charge money for your consults**
Since April 2018 it is possible to offer webcam consultations via our platform against online payment, both on appointment and walk-in hours via your website. It is very easy to set up your rates and VAT rules, connect to your own Paypal account and start to charge your clients for your consults!

Examples of use cases:
*	An alternative for physical health care consults.
*	Additional communication options for home care.
*	Deployment as a first point of contact, for example, an interview with services such as lawyers, accountants or for example mortgage consultant.
*	Digital box at municipalities and other authorities.
*	Direct help for online tutoring.
*	For additional service at online shops, where a chat feature is too limited.
*	The recruitment and selection process. Read more in our whitepaper, Live online recruitment.
